TPS #1
5. We do not need to declare n in the data segment


TPS #2
1. Putting in 5 gives 29
4. We have to store $a0 so we can pass it to the recursion function
5. Since our value comes from $v0, we can tell the system to print it while we update the value
7. We have 3 values to store integers in a stack frame, and the first is for the retuen address
10. We need $a0 to check if m is 0
12. Our incoming values will replace the old values
15. This is the return address of our branch
