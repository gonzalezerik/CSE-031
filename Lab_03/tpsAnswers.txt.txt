TPS #1
1. The 3 pools of memory are static, stack and heap. Static holds global variables, stack holds local variables and the heap is essentially dynamic storage that is not allocated (malloc).
2a. There are 3 variables declared, num, ptr and handle.
2b. Two of them are pointers (ptr and handle). ptr points to memory and handle points to the pointer ptr (both are integers) . 
2c. These variables are stored in the stack, since we called them dynamically.
2d. It is allocating space off the heap (malloc).

TPS #2
