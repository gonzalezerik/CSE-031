1. I have 4 levels of cache, in particular: L1D Cache, L1I Cache, L2 Cache, L3 Cache
2. Both L1s are 32KB in size, L2 is 256KB and L3 is 4MB. 
3. The block size is 64 bytes.
4. L1 is 8-way set associative, L2 is 4-way set asociatve, L3 is 16-way set associative
5. Since there's 64 bytes in our block, our offset is equal to 2^x =64, meaning that our offset has 3 bits. To get index, we use the number of blocks in the cache. We use 8 cache blocks, so a set contains 24 bytes. After dividing, we roughly get 1K sets, so our set field has 10 bits. Aftet that, we subtract 3 and 10 from 32, which means our TAG field is 19 bits.
