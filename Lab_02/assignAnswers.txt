Assignment #1
1. Line 15 in the read_values, we weren't passing in the address of our input correctly 
2. You just put an ampersand in front of "input" so it reads it's address 
3. The bug is that the sum parameter is never getting updated and it remains 0.
4. I passed the sum as a pointer and updated it, it seemed to work.

Assignment #2
1. No, the output is not expected. It seems jumbled.
2. No, the output is not expected. It seems to be overflowing and the str2 is repeated twice. I think the bug was that the char array had to be filled up.
3. The output is not expected. I think that it is "chopping" every word after 4 characters.
